/*
 * "iScream" is a fun and interactive game in which the players are competing to see who can make the loudest and longest screams!
 * 
 * The game uses the microphone sensor on the Circuit Playground board to track the decibel level of the screams and light up the LEDs accordingly.
 * The game has two modes: two-player and one-player, which are determined by a slide switch and can be changed at any time during the game. 
 * In two-player mode, players must beat each other's previous scores, whereas in one-player mode, regardless of the player's score, 
 * a constant number is added to the bar.Â 
 * 
 * The game ends when one player loses and the LEDs turn red. If a player screamed for as much time as needed, the LEDs turned white.
